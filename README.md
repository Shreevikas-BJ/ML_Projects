🚀 My Project Portfolio

Welcome!
This repository showcases a collection of projects built with passion, curiosity, and a continuous drive to learn and create.

Each folder represents a part of my journey — building intelligent systems, optimizing deep learning models for real-time performance, and solving real-world problems using AI, machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, data analytics, and LLMs.

📂 Featured Projects
1. Real-Time Road Pothole Detection (YOLOv8m + TensorRT + Flask)

A real-time computer vision system that detects potholes from video streams.
Optimized with TensorRT + CUDA for high-FPS inference in automotive safety and smart road monitoring.

2. IT Helpdesk AI Agent (LangChain + LangGraph + PyTorch)

An end-to-end agentic system that:

Classifies IT tickets

Retrieves evidence using RAG

Plans safe fixes with Ollama/GPT

Executes commands only after judge verification

3. Medical Chatbot (RAG + GPT-3.5 + FAISS)

A health-focused chatbot retrieving responses from CDC/WHO documents.
Uses fallback LLM reasoning when context is missing.

4. House Price Predictor (XGBoost)

Regression model trained on real housing data.
Includes feature engineering, cleaning, and RMSE-based performance evaluation.

5. Customer Churn Prediction (Logistic Regression)

Predicts telecom customer churn using demographics and usage patterns.
Includes EDA, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.

6. Sentiment Analysis App (BERT + Streamlit)

A web app that classifies movie review sentiment using a fine-tuned BERT model
built with Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.

7. NVIDIA Stock Forecasting (ARIMA + LSTM + GARCH)

Time-series forecasting and risk modeling to analyze trends and volatility
in NVIDIA stock performance.

8. COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis (SQL)

SQL-driven analysis uncovering insights and trends in global vaccination data.
